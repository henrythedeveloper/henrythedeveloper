# **Yo!** 👊
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an undergraduate computer science student, working on a range of projects that blend my interests in generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), e-commerce, and web development. My work spans from full-stack development to deep learning applications, showcasing my learning journey and hands-on experience. 💻✨

# **Projects** 🛠️

## 1. **Query Kicks** 👟

An 8-bit e-commerce store that displays pixel art shoes, called "Query Kicks." This project features PHP and MySQL with user account functionality, shopping cart capabilities, and data management via phpMyAdmin.

## 2. **Employee Manager Application** 👥

A web application designed to manage employee records with features to update, add, and delete entries.

## 3. **LangFlow-based RAG System** ⚙️🖥️

Currently building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project utilizing LangFlow to facilitate part selection, similar to a "PC-Part Picker" tool.

## 4. **Explainable AI Projects** 🤖🔍

Projects involving Orange for explainable machine learning, with a focus on image-based datasets and concepts like LIME and counterfactuals to explain AI behavior.

# **Skills and Tools** 🛠️

- **Web Development**: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 🌐

- **Backend & Databases**: SQL, MySQL, Docker, Supabase 🗄️

- **AI & Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, LangChain, Orange 🤖

- **Collaboration & Team Projects**: Git, Power Automate, teamwork on group projects 🤝

# **About Me** 🧑‍💻

I'm passionate about generative models, web development, and the intersection of AI with creative applications. My interests include:

- **Fantasy Elements & Storytelling**: I love incorporating creative and imaginative ideas into my projects. 🏰✨

- **Music & Instrumentation**: I'm a cellist and guitarist, and I enjoy exploring the intersection between music and technology. 🎻🎶
